			'Designed a Machine Learning Pipeline & Models to predict powerlifting totals for competition lifts. The models are very highly performant (R¬≤ >= 0.97). Performed data cleaning and curating, optimizing for lowest feature space possible with performance. Implemented custom classification reporting and analysis to parse results.'

			'Worked on a team to create a high performance viewshed computation, running on multiple GPUs and CPUs across a clustered network. Designed and implemented the MPI control structure for the division of critical data across the network, and the accompanying distributed CPU approach. Created data visualizations and produced scaling reporting for the final program to demonstrate a 3600x increase in performance over single core.'
